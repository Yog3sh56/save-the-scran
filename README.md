## Overview
Save the scran is an app designed to reduce food wastage by allowing communities to come together digitally, share food items and prevent avoidable food wastage. For example, suppose you have a food item lying in your fridge approaching its expiry date. However, you are not planning on consuming it. In that case, you can list it in the community market where other people can view the item. Then, if they are interested, they can message you to collect the food item - reducing food wastage and carbon footprint. 

## Motivation
Around 1.3 billion tonnes of food produced globally is wasted each year. **In Scotland, 1.35 million tonnes of food and drink wastages** was estimated in 2013. Likewise, 600,000 tonnes of food and drink wastage was produced in 2014, out of which **60% was classed as avoidable**. Approximately 20% of Scotland’s carbon footprint is generated by food waste where, avoidable food wastage is accountable for 2.1%, which is equivalent to 1.6 million tonnes of carbon dioxide. Similarly, the **financial cost for avoidable food waste is around £1.1 billion per year**. Scotland has set a target to reduce food wastage by 33% by 2025.

**Save the scran** as a project aims to support that goal by reducing individual food wastage. The app allows user to add food and information about the food, such as expiry date, into the virtual fridge by taking a picture. For example, suppose the food is approaching its expiry date. In that case, the user can choose to put the item onto the community market. Other users can view the article and message the owner to arrange pickup. This way, a food item can be shared amongst the community market, reducing avoidable food waste.

### Target
Our solution will help households to prevent food waste by implementing two strategies. We will **remind people** about the food they have stored and when it will go out of date and by **making it easy for people to give away food** that they will not be able to use and would usually throw away.
Our app will therefore focus on the **prevention of food waste and redistribution of food**.
